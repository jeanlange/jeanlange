# Hi!
I'm Jean. Get at me at jean.f.lange@gmail.com

Many of my contributions on github are:
* 🧮 projects for [Academy Pittsburgh](http://academypgh.com) classes, to demonstrate concepts, languages, and frameworks.
* ✎ documentation fixes for open source projects I was reading about or using.

Many of my contributions in real life are around speaking! Find Academy talks [on Twitch](twitch.tv/academypgh)
