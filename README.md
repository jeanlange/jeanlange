# Hi!
I'm Jean. Get at me at jean.f.lange@gmail.com

Many of my contributions on github are:
* projects for (Academy Pittsburgh)[http://academypgh.com] classes, to demonstrate concepts, languages, and frameworks.
* documentation fixes for OS projects I was reading or using.

Many of my contributions in real life are around speaking! Find Academy talks (on Twitch)[twitch.tv/academypgh]
