# Hi!
I'm Jean. Get at me at jean.f.lange@gmail.com

Many of my contributions on github are:
* ðŸ§® projects for [Academy Pittsburgh](http://academypgh.com) classes, to demonstrate concepts, languages, and frameworks.
  * ðŸ“› Want a place to start? Try [this nametags project](https://github.com/jeanlange/react-nametags) in React. You can watch me build it/teach about concepts in these videos: [part 1](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1845577080?filter=all&sort=time) and [part 2](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1846373430?filter=all&sort=time)
* âœŽ documentation fixes for open source projects I was reading about or using.

Many of my contributions in real life are around speaking! Find Academy talks [on Twitch](twitch.tv/academypgh)
