# Hi!
I'm Jean. Get at me at jean.f.lange@gmail.com

Many of my contributions on github are:
* ðŸ§® projects for [Academy Pittsburgh](http://academypgh.com) classes, to demonstrate concepts, languages, and frameworks.
  * ðŸ“› Want a place to start? Try [this nametags project](https://github.com/jeanlange/react-nametags) in React. You can watch me build it/teach about concepts in [this video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1845577080?filter=all&sort=time).
  * ðŸ”— I'm also fond of this public-facing lunch and learn about linked lists as they appear in technical interviews. Watch me explain recursion for people who might not understand it super well!
    * [repo](https://github.com/jeanlange/linked-list-demo) - check out the commit history to see how I walked through the concepts. It also links to the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13wgPae7YPyyH0BDis7J5VgcjbPsedvz4A_8Ibmv5UnM/edit?usp=sharing).
    * [video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/899743456) - 1:10.
* âœŽ documentation fixes for open source projects I was reading about or using.

Many of my contributions in real life are around speaking! Find Academy talks [on Twitch](twitch.tv/academypgh)
